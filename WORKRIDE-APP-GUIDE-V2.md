## 1. Executive Summary

**Problem (Nigeria 2026):** Fuel N1,200-1,450/litre (505% increase from N175 in 2023), transport fares up 50-100% (Kubwa-Bannex N500→N1,000), workers spend 50% of salary on commuting (was 20%), FCT residents abandon cars, walk long distances, low-income earners stranded. No standard public transport.

**Solution:** WorkRide is NOT ride-hailing. It is **3 layers:**
1. **Ride-Share & Staff Bus Aggregator** for verified civil servants (corridor-based, fixed price, volunteer free rides)
2. **GTFS Publisher** — Abuja's first transit feed, searchable on Google Maps (like Hyderabad JNTUH→Charminar experience)
3. **Road Intelligence Network** — 1,000 cars as probes using phone sensors (accelerometer, GPS, gyroscope) to map potholes, IRI, slope — World Bank RoadLab method

**Inspiration:** Nairobi Digital Matatus (135 routes mapped → Google Maps), India Quick Ride (37k Wipro staff saved Rs 3.8 Crore fuel), Lagos BRT ($1.7M/km vs $6M global, 180k riders/day), Brazil BlaBlaCar (14M trips).

## 2. Business Model & Funding Strategy (NEW - Comprehensive)

### 2.1 Hybrid Structure for Community + Profit
To get funding as community project AND be sustainable like Uber:

**WorkRide Community Trust (60% - Non-profit):**
* Owns: GTFS data, Road Intelligence data, Open-source core
* Mission: Subsidy for working class, research, open data for FERMA
* Funded by: Grants, Govt, International donors

**WorkRide Operations Ltd (40% - For-Profit):**
* Owns: App, Wallet, Matching algorithm, Premium features
* Mission: Profit to sustain workforce, tech, expansion
* Revenue shares 15% of profit back to Trust

This is how **Mozilla + Firefox**, **OpenStreetMap** work — fundable as social impact, but sustainable.

### 2.2 Revenue Streams (8 Streams - Data Driven)

| # | Stream | How It Works | Pricing (Abuja) | Projected Monthly (at 2,000 daily rides) | Global Example |
|---|--------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Commission on Paid Rides** | 10% on paid carpool (vs Bolt 20-25%) | ₦600 fare → ₦60 commission | ₦2.6M | Quick Ride takes 10% |
| 2 | **Corporate Corridor Pass (B2B)** | Ministry/Company pays per staff/month for unlimited rides in corridor | ₦15,000/staff/month (saves staff ₦30k) | ₦7.5M for 500 staff (1 MDA) | Wipro/Infosys model - 6 of top 10 IT firms |
| 3 | **Staff Bus Seat Monetization** | List empty seats of FCTA/Private staff buses on WorkRide | ₦200/seat, 50% to bus owner | ₦1.2M (20 buses x 30 seats x 50% full) | Lagos BRT cooperative model |
| 4 | **Subsidy Management Fee** | MDA loads subsidy_credits for staff, we charge 3% fee for audit trail | ₦10M subsidy → ₦300k fee | ₦900k (3 MDAs) | India fuel subsidy token programs |
| 5 | **Road Intelligence API** | Sell road condition data: IRI, potholes CSV, traffic | ₦500k/month to logistics, FERMA, construction | ₦1.5M (3 clients) | World Bank RoadLab sells to govts |
| 6 | **GTFS Data License** | Charge Google, Moovit, private apps for premium GTFS-RT | Free static GTFS (community), Paid RT at $0.01/call | ₦800k | Nairobi Digital Matatus licensed to 5 apps |
| 7 | **Green Credits & CSR** | Companies buy CO2 certificates: 1 tonne = ₦5k for ESG reporting | Wipro saved 1,308 tonnes | ₦2M (400 tonnes) | Capgemini 65% emission reduction campaign |
| 8 | **Premium Verification + Insurance** | ₦1,000/year for priority matching, accident micro-insurance | ₦1k/year | ₦200k (200 drivers) | GrabShare premium |

**Total MVP:** ₦16.7M/month at just 2,000 rides/day + 1 MDA + 3 data clients. Break-even at 800 rides/day.

### 2.3 Funding Ladder (From Community to Global)

**Stage 1: Community & Grants (Now - $10k-$50k)**
* Target: **FCT Innovation Fund, Ford Foundation, World Bank Youth Innovation, Google.org, MIT Solve**
* Pitch: "Abuja's first GTFS + RoadLab, built by civil servants, open data for FERMA, reduces fuel poverty"
* Deliverable: GTFS feed + 500 users + Road map
* Equity: 0% - grant

**Stage 2: Government & MDA Subsidy (Month 3-6 - $50k-$200k)**
* Target: **Head of Service, Federal Ministry of Works, FCTA Transport Secretariat, Office of the Vice President (palliatives)**
* Pitch: "Your N10M palliative in subsidy_credits → trackable, auditable, goes directly to worker transport, not cash diversion. Dashboard shows every ride, CO2 saved."
* Model: MDA buys subsidy_credits at 10% discount, distributes to staff via WorkRide wallet
* Regulation: Get letter as "Approved Staff Mobility Partner for FCT"

**Stage 3: Angel & Impact Investors (Month 6-12 - $200k-$500k)**
* Target: **Lagos Angel Network, Future Africa, Ventures Platform, Google for Startups Africa**
* Valuation: $1.5M pre-money (based on GTFS data moat + 2,000 daily active + MDA contract)
* Use: Hire 5 engineers, launch 3 corridors, OSRM self-hosted maps

**Stage 4: VC & International Expansion (Year 2 - $2M-$5M)**
* Target: **IFC (invested $15M in BlaBlaCar Brazil), Partech, YC**
* Metrics needed: 10k DAU, 100k rides/month, $50k MRR, GTFS in 2 cities (Abuja + Lagos)
* Expansion: Nairobi (copy Digital Matatus), Accra, Kampala — same fuel crisis, same playbook

**Stage 5: Global Platform (Year 3+ - Like Uber)**
* Become **GTFS-Flex standard for informal carpools** globally
* White-label to governments: "WorkRide for Nairobi", "WorkRide for Manila"
* IPO path: Community Trust retains data ownership, Operations Ltd lists

### 2.4 Profit Allocation (Sustainable Workforce)
* 40% - Workforce salaries + tech (engineers, verification officers)
* 20% - Research (RoadLab AI, IRI accuracy, EV transition)
* 15% - Community Trust (subsidy for low-income, free rides fund)
* 15% - Profit reserve + expansion
* 10% - Competition & Marketing (referral bonuses, Green Points)

### 2.5 Research & Competition Fund (Built-in)
* **WorkRide Research Lab:** Partner with University of Abuja, FUTA — publish papers on IRI in Nigeria, fuel saving models (like MIT did)
* **Annual WorkRide Green Challenge:** Prize ₦1M for best corridor optimization idea — builds community, PR
* **Bug Bounty:** ₦10k for pothole reporting, ₦50k for security bug

## 3. Application Architecture

### Philosophy: DUAL-APP SYSTEM
**App 1: WorkRide Rider PWA (Public)** - Lightweight <1MB for passengers/drivers to book. Built with Blade+Tailwind+Alpine.
**App 2: WorkRide Control Tower (Ops) - Filament Admin PWA** - The brain for ops team: Demand Calendar, Duty Roster, Asset & Maintenance, Driver Scores, Finance Settlement, Stakeholder Remittance, GTFS Dashboard, Road Heatmap. This split is how Uber/Lyft/Bolt operate (Rider/Driver/God-view).

Core: Modular Monolith → Event-Driven → GTFS Publisher → Road Intelligence → Operations. Change Control: Identify (sensor), Ensure beneficial (verified), Contain (corridor + geofence), Manage (audit log + maintenance + stakeholder ledger).

## 12. Regulatory, Legal & Competition Strategy

### Government Regulations (Nigeria)
* **NIN & NDPR:** Never store raw NIN, only SHA256 hash + last 4. Get NDPA compliance, consent checkbox. Data hosted in Nigeria (MainOne/NG-COM).
* **FCTA & VIO:** Register as "Staff Mobility Cooperative" not ride-hailing to avoid VIO crackdown. Get letter as Approved Partner. Vehicles must have papers_verified.
* **NITDA:** Open data license for GTFS static (CC BY 4.0), private for RT. Road data shared with FERMA free.
* **Insurance:** Partner with Leadway/Coron for micro-insurance ₦100/trip included in fare.
* **Tax:** VAT on commission only, not on subsidy_credits (palliative). Get TIN.

### Competition (Bolt, Uber, InDrive)
* **Differentiation:** Bolt is surge + individual + expensive. WorkRide is fixed-price corridor + verified colleagues + subsidy + Google Maps searchable + road data. Can't be copied easily.
* **Moat:** GTFS data + workplace verification + MDA contracts + road intelligence. Bolt cannot get MDA staff ID list.
* **Anti-Competition:** Keep commission 10% vs Bolt 20-25%. Volunteer free rides kill price war. Community Trust prevents acquisition.
* **Union Strategy:** Don't fight NURTW. Onboard danfo/coaster drivers as verified drivers, give them cooperative shares like Lagos BRT did (First BRT Cooperative). 1 high-capacity bus replaces 5 danfos.

### International Adoption Playbook
* **Phase 1 Abuja:** Prove 2,000 rides/day + GTFS + 1 MDA.
* **Phase 2 Lagos:** Copy BRT low-cost model $1.7M/km vs $6M. Partner LAMATA, seed 75k danfo routes.
* **Phase 3 Africa:** Nairobi (Digital Matatus already mapped, need carpool layer), Accra, Kampala — same fuel crisis. White-label GTFS-Flex.
* **Phase 4 Global South:** Manila, Haiphong, Zhengzhou World Bank pilots — pitch as "WorkRide for Manila".
* **Tech for Global:** Multi-tenant Laravel: `workplaces` table has `country_id`, `city_id`. GTFS per city. OSM self-hosted per region. Currency via config.

### Risk Mitigation
* Fuel price drops: Pivot to Green Credits + time saving pitch
* Govt bans: Community Trust owns data, can operate as NGO
* Fraud: NIN hash + staff ID + guarantor + rating + activity_log
* Low smartphone: USSD fallback *347*WORK# for booking (future)

---

## 13. International Adoption & Scaling

Multi-tenant: countries table, cities table, workplaces belong to city. GTFS per city. OSRM per region. Currency config/workride.php. Language: English, Hausa, Yoruba, French for Africa.

Scaling: Phase1 Single VPS Hetzner, Phase2 Vapor + Redis GEO, Phase3 OSRM self-hosted, Phase4 Kubernetes + S3.

White-label: WorkRide Core (open) + WorkRide City Pack (paid) for new city — includes WorkplaceSeeder + GTFS validator.

Global pitch: "From Abuja to the world — built by amateurs, proven in fuel crisis, now powering staff mobility in Nairobi, Manila, Bogota."

## 9B. Real Demand Data Collection - BRT Pre-Design Method for Abuja (NEW - Field Research)

### The Problem: Abuja has no bus stops, people wait at junctions (Berger, Banex, Wuse Market). How to count them?

Lagos BRT did 3 studies before design:
1. Origin-Destination (OD) Survey - Where do people come from / go to?
2. Boarding-Alighting Counts - How many enter/exit at each stop?
3. Classified Traffic Counts - Vehicle types per road per hour

You will do same but with phones, not consultants.

### Method 1: Junction Count (Manual - ₦0, Day 1) - Like LAMATA 2008
Team of 3 NYSC interns with your Driver App in "Survey Mode":
- Stand at Kubwa Junction, Berger, Banex, Nyanya Under-Bridge, Lugbe
- Every 15 mins, count: How many people waiting? Destination they shout? Time? Take photo.
- App: POST /api/v1/demand-surveys {junction_id, count, destination_text, time, photo}
- Table: `demand_surveys` id, junction_id FK, count, destination, hour, day_type weekday/weekend, weather, collected_by, lat/lng, photo_path
- Result after 1 week: You know "Berger 6:30-7:30am = 320 people waiting, 80% to CBD"

### Method 2: Probe Data from Volunteer Cars (Automatic - Free)
Every WorkRide car is a sensor. When driver moves slowly at junction (speed <5km/h for >2 mins), log as "congestion + potential demand point". After 1 month, heatmap of where cars slow = where people wait.

Table: `probe_demand_points` lat/lng, avg_speed, dwell_time, times_visited

### Method 3: Workplace OD Survey (Google Form + App - ₦0)
Send to 500 civil servants in 3 MDAs: "Where do you live (Kubwa/Lugbe etc), What time do you leave home, What time you reach office, How much you pay?"
Result: OD Matrix: Kubwa→CBD 45%, Nyanya→CBD 30% etc.

Table: `od_surveys` id, workplace_id, home_area, departure_time, arrival_time, fare_paid, mode (keke/bus)

### Method 4: USSD/WhatsApp Demand Bot (For low-smartphone users)
*347*WORK# → "Where are you? Where you dey go? How many people dey there?" → Saves to demand_surveys. Critical for junction people without app.

### Method 5: Check-in Feature in Rider App (Crowdsourced)
Passenger at junction taps "I'm at Berger Junction, need ride to Secretariat, 2 people". Even if no driver yet, you collect demand. This becomes your future supply plan.

Table: `demand_requests` id, user_id, pickup_lat/lng, destination_text, passengers_count, requested_at, status (pending/matched)

### How This Becomes GTFS + Scheduling:
- demand_surveys → becomes GtfsStop importance + service frequency
- od_surveys → becomes routes.txt (KUB-CBD) + calendar.txt (peak hours)
- demand_requests → becomes real-time dispatch: Ops sees "12 people waiting at Nyanya now" → pushes extra bus

### Control Tower UI for This:
- Map: Circles sized by count (Berger big, Jabi small) per hour slider 5am-10pm
- OD Matrix Table: From/To counts
- Peak Hour Chart: 6am-9am surge curve per corridor
- Export for BRT report: CSV for World Bank format

This is exactly what World Bank and LAMATA did, but you do it with ₦50k interns + phones vs $100k consultants.



## 9. Demand Forecasting & Event Planning (NEW - Critical for Profit)

### Why 90% of apps fail: They react, not forecast.
Abuja demand is NOT random. It follows: Religious (Juma'a Fri 1-2:30pm low, Sunday Church 6-11am surge CBD), Government (FAAC, FEC Mondays, Salary week 25th-5th = +60% demand, Budget defence NASS), Events (Eagles at MKO Stadium, NYSC Kubwa), Weather (Rainy Apr-Oct +40% surge).

### Database: forecasts table
`id, date, event_type ENUM(church,mosque,govt,festive,weather,fuel_scarcity), event_name, corridor, expected_demand_multiplier decimal (0.7 to 2.0), recommended_extra_vehicles INT, notes, created_by`

### Feature in Ops Control Tower:
Demand Calendar UI: Admin inputs known events ahead. System auto-suggests: "This Friday is Juma'a + FAAC: Reduce CBD trips 30%, add 5 buses to mosque corridors after 2:30pm. Saturday is environmental sanitation - no movement 7-10am."

### Forecasting Algorithm (Phase1 Manual, Phase2 ML):
Phase1: Manual multiplier based on 3 months logging.
Phase2 Job `CalculateDemandForecastJob`: Uses past bookings per weekday/hour/corridor + events to predict. Formula: `predicted = avg_last_4_same_weekday * event_multiplier`

This saves 30% fuel by not deploying empty buses.

## 10. Stakeholder Management & Union Integration (NEW - Make or Break)

### Stakeholder Map Abuja:

| Stakeholder | Want | Strategy | Tech Feature |
|-------------|------|----------|--------------|
| NURTW/RTEAN/Jabi/Berger/Nyanya unions | Daily ticket, control | Make them agents: 5% of corridor bookings, their park = official hub. Don't fight. | `stakeholder_remittances` table: trip_id, union_id, amount, status |
| FCTA Transport Sec, VIO, DRTS | Regulation, safety, permit | Register as Staff Mobility Cooperative not commercial taxi. Get Approved Partner letter. | `permits` table: expiry reminders |
| MDAs (offices) | Punctuality proof for subsidy | Sell Subsidy Dashboard: trackable palliative | `subsidy_reports` printable |
| Security | Verification | NIN-hashed verification selling point | VerificationLevel 0-3 |

### Wallet Integration:
Every trip auto-calculates: `driver_earning = fare - commission(10%) - union_fee(5%) - insurance(₦100)`. Wallet has 3 payable balances: `driver_payable, union_payable, govt_tax_payable`. Daily settlement job via Moniepoint API.

## 11. Fleet Lifecycle: Acquisition, Maintenance, Disposal (NEW - Enterprise Grade)

### Philosophy: Start lean, asset-light.
Day1: Don't buy buses. Lease 3x 18-seater from existing companies (Agofure, Cross River) for Kubwa-CBD pilot. Capex 0. Use lease-to-own tracked in DB.

### Database Tables:

**assets:** `id, asset_type ENUM(bus,car,obd2_device), acquisition_type ENUM(lease,owned,donated), vin, plate_number unique, make, model, year, purchase_cost, lease_monthly, depreciation_rate, mileage INT, status ENUM(active,in_maintenance,grounded,disposed), assigned_driver_id, corridor, created_at`

**maintenance_schedules:** `id, asset_id FK, type ENUM(preventive_5000km,monthly_inspection), due_km, due_date, status`

**inspections (Daily Pre-Trip):** `id, asset_id FK, driver_id FK, date, tyre_photo_path, oil_level, interior_photo, is_passed bool, notes` - If not passed, trip publish blocked via middleware.

**faults:** `id, asset_id FK, reported_by, description, voice_note_path, severity, status ENUM(open,in_progress,fixed), created_at` - From driver app.

**telemetry (OBD2 + Phone):** `id, asset_id FK, lat/lng, speed, fuel_level, engine_fault_code, harsh_braking bool, created_at` - OBD2 dongle ₦25k reads fuel, fault.

### Workflow: 
Driver opens Driver App 6am → Must complete Inspection checklist + 5 photos → If fail → Fault ticket → Ops notified → Bus grounded. OBD2 mileage auto-updates → When reaches 5,000km → Maintenance Schedule auto-creates.

Disposal: After 4 years or 250k km, system flags: `status=disposal_due`, calculates resale value = purchase_cost - (depreciation*years).
